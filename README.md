# Interrupt driven and buffered UART for the Arduino Nano Every

**``By Hans-Henrik Fuxelius, 2023-05-29``

This librarary is **fully described** [HERE](https://github.com/fuxelius/atmega_avr_uart_v2) and this repo is intended for testing it on the [Arduino Nano Every](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-every) (ATmega4809) and evaluation for anyone interested in using the code! The setup for how to compile this code is detailed in [C Programming for 'Arduino Nano Every' Board (ATmega4809) with a Mac and VS Code](https://github.com/fuxelius/nano_every_bare_metal#c-programming-for-arduino-nano-every-board-atmega4809-with-a-mac-and-vs-code). Compiling it on **Microchip Studio** should also be easy!
